[technology-description]
natural-gas-processing=Natural Gas is an easy hydrocarbon mix to extract and separate, but has somewhat limited uses without extensive use of energy-expensive reforming methods, due to the predominance of short carbon chains.
crude-oil-processing=Crude Oil is an amalgam of many hydrocarbons, making it useful as a starting point.
tar-sand-processing=A thick, viscious fluid, full of sand and long hydrocarbons, Tar Sand is very difficult to process, requiring several steps. Those that have the capability to process it correctly will find it useful.
oil-processing=The basics of Fractionating raw hydrocarbon feedstocks into usable products.
basic-syngas-processing=Reforming is an invaluable process for utilizing lower-tier hydrocarbons.
coal-liquefaction=The Fischer-Tropsch Process is a revolutionary process by which hydrocarbons can be produced from carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This opens up many options for Syngas usage.
gas-fracking=Reserves of Natural Gas can be found all over. Typically, they're too small to be worth bothering about, but if you can access a dozen of them at once, it becomes more economical.
