Version: 1.1.2
Date: 05. 12. 23
  Features:
    - Added a water electrolysis recipe.
  Balance:
    - Doubled the energy density of hydrogen, halved all production and usage of it.
    - Rebalanced rocket fuel production. Hydrogen rocket fuel now takes more hydrogen, and only outputs 1 rocket fuel. Methane rocket fuel changed to reflect this. Kerosene rocket fuel uses less kerosene.
    - Sulfur recipe can now have productivity modules.
    - Lubricant now uses sulfur. Lubricant can be made directly from Raw Fuel Oil without adding sulfur.
    - Sulfur processing now uses steam and outputs water instead of hydrogen.
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed Diesel and Rubber, as they are unused.

Version: 1.1.0
Date: 26. 04. 23
  Features:
    - Added a setting for higher tiers of Fractionators
    - Added a setting for higher tiers of Gas Wellhead
    - Hydrogen Sulfide now has a fuel value. And a pollution modifier.
    - Fractionators are now assembling machines that need the recipe set.
  Balance:
    - Reduced how much Hydrogen Sulfide the sulfur recipe uses.
    - Doubled Natural Gas Fractionation time from 0.5s to 1s
    - Reduced the Methane used by rocket fuel
    - Reduced the crafting time of both Hydrogen and Methane rocket fuel.
    - Moved the Steam Methane Reforming recipe from the Syngas tech to Oil Processing.
    - Tar sand processing is now a 1/1/1 ratio of chemical plants for the 3 steps
    - Tar sand now makes more for the same amount of tar sand
    - Reduced time on Bitumen fractionation
  Bugfixes:
    - Fractionator Entity Icons now also show their fuel input type
    - Fixed the Gasifier fluidboxes being *weird*
	- Fixed the changelog using tabs so it can't show up in-game
	- Localised the Methane Reforming recipe
	- Locked the Gasifier recipe behind the same tech as the Gasifier
	- Locked all the fractionators behind having oil
    - Fixed infinite syngas

Version: 1.0.4
Date: 12. 04. 23
  Features:
    - Stone in the latter 2 Tar Sand processing recipes is replaced with sand if it exists, or silica if that exists and sand doesn't."
    - Added an incompatibility with Brevven's Natural Gas
  Bugfixes:
    - Sand is no longer present unless another mod adds it. Tar sand processing now uses all stone by default. For real this time
    - Kerosene is no longer hydrogen hungry.

Version: 1.0.3
Date: 11. 04. 23
  Features:
    - Carbon is replaced with Coke, if Brevven's Foundry is present.
    - Stone in the latter 2 Tar Sand processing recipes is replaced with sand if it exists, or silica if that exists and sand doesn't.
    - Reduced how much sulfur is produced.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed the Aromatics Sulfur recipe not showing up.
    - Sand is no longer present unless another mod adds it. Tar sand processing now uses all stone by default.
    - Fixed the icon size for tar sand and bitumen
    - Removed fracking. It wasn't supposed to exist.
